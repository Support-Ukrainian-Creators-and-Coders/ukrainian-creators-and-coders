# :ukraine: Ukrainian Creators And Coders :ukraine:
## ðŸš© Update: Click <b>[here](https://bit.ly/supportukrainedevs)</b> to support a new, random dev with each click. We collected almost 200 (and counting) developer profiles.  We scraped all of [chernivtsijs/made-in-ukraine](https://github.com/chernivtsijs/made-in-ukraine) and of [IonicaBizau/made-in-ukraine](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/made-in-ukraine) and put them in spreadsheets, so this data is now navigable and fungible. We thank this awesome repositories of made-in-Ukraine open source software.

A repository to collect ukrainian creators (musicians, youtubers, bloggers, content creators of any kind) and developers (and their open source projects) so people can show support and donate to the very persons involved without intermediaries (stream their songs, donate to a project, buy their art), star their projects, make job offers, arrange refuge. There are many free options to support Ukraine that cost only an open browser tab or a few clicks.

For now we've made two google spreadsheets (one for creators and one for devs/oss) where anyone can edit and a [website](https://support-ukrainian-creators-and-coders.github.io/random-supporter/) that attempts to make supporting easier, engaging and randomized. 
If you want to help out or suggest a better workflow reach out to us on [stopitvladimir@gmail.com](mailto:stopitvladimir@gmail.com).

To comment on a cell of the spreadsheets, right click on the cell and select "Comment".
Please include relevant links to the creators/dev githubs, bandcamps, spotifys, instagram, etc. so they can be verified as actual people.
