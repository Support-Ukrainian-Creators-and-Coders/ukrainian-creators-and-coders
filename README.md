# Ukrainian Creators And Coders
## Work In Progress: while we fill this lists together, why not have a look to [this](https://github.com/chernivtsijs/made-in-ukraine) and [this](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/made-in-ukraine) awesome repositories of made-in-Ukraine open source software?
A repository to collect ukrainian creators (musicians, youtubers, bloggers, content creators of any kind) and developers (and their open source projects) so people can show support and donate to the very persons involved without intermediaries (stream their songs, donate to a project, buy their art, etc.)

For now we've made two google spreadsheets (one for creators and one for devs/oss where anyone can comment but only we can edit, if you want to help out or suggest a better workflow reach out to us on [stopitvladimir@gmail.com](mailto:stopitvladimir@gmail.com).

To comment on a cell of the spreadsheets, right click on the cell and select "Comment".
We will verify your suggestions and proceed to input them.
Please include relevant links to the creators/dev githubs, bandcamps, spotifys, instagram, etc. 
If a cell is already commented do not overwrite it, please.
